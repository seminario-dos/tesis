To increase the practical applicability of these models, we finally combine the low-level I/O performance models with high-level software architecture models.},

abstract="The widespread use of cloud computing and services has modified IS architectures which have been well established and consolidated in the past. We can call this ``The Era of (software) MicroServices'' which has led towards the adoption of Information Systems models independent from traditional tiered-architecture. MicroServices offer a new conceptualization adopting a distributed system decomposing the architecture legacy in micro-components, each one with an independent life-cycle yet interconnected and correlated. Two new concepts arise: ``Continuous Integration'', referred as CI, and ``Continuous Delivery'', referred as CD. Each MicroService is hosted within a single object denominated ``container'' which has a proper lifecycle and often with a unikernel-operating system with minimal sets of executable libraries. The paper then discusses the new technological tendencies under the lens of an organizational approach to new aspects of development and the emerging security solutions introduced by MicroServices, in particular for existing legacy systems.",
